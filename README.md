# AVLtree_Heap_DataStructure
1-Used Avl Tree implementaion to add city Information record from a File, in following format: City_name / City_related_data_file_name 
                                    using the data file created in step 1, build an AVL tree of City nodes,
Avl Tree has:
Print out cities sorted.
• Search for a specific city
• Insert a new city.
• Delete a specific city.
• Calculate tree height.

2-using the city_related _date_file_name that stored in each tree city node, load the resident data that
stored in each file. The resident record data format in these files is as follow:
ID_#/Full_name/Age/Gender
create a Hash Table using the resident data

HashTable implement the following functions on resident hash table:
• Print hashed table (including empty spots).
• Print out table size.
• Print out used hash function.
• Insert a new record to hash table.
• Search for a specific record.
• Delete a specific record.
• Save hash table back to file
